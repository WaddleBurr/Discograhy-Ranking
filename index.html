      <h1>A note:</h1>
         <p>I unfortunately haven't finished this webpage. I am quite saddenend that I have not gotten it done on time, but this is my own doing as I bit off WAY more than I could chew. All albums that were planned to have a rating have been given one and all songs for Tally Hall and Coldplay have a rating. I have only finished the custom colors for the Coldplay page. I haven't written any album reviews yet (which is honestly the most fun part) as I wanted to finish everything first. Arguably, I never called this an album review website but instead an album ranking website so technically I have ranked the albums. Yet, I still want to write some reviews for them as that is why I wanted to do this site in the first place. On a brighter note, I still plan to finish this website even if I was not able to finish it by the deadline. I will notify anyone interested when it is done (albiet the only people who would be interested would probably be my mom and maybe my professor). </p>

      <p><span class="superstar">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</span> This is a special ranking given to songs (not albums) that I consider <span class="star"><b><i>essentials</i></b></span>. There are many things I take into consideration when giving this ranking (more than just my opinion on the main lists). On the Other Artist section, it is just a better 5 star.</p>
